# NicoletEegImportOld
Old program to import Nicolet/Nervus EEG data to EEGLAB. Requires Nicolet DLLs, not stand-alone.

## History

This code was written in C++ in the early 2000s, but the source code was lost. Only the .exe file in the form of an installer is available. The MATLAB wrapper code is available.

## Requirements

The conversion program (.exe file) requires Nicolet DLLs installed on the computer. These Nicolet DLLs are commercial and proprietary. You must gain access to these through a customer of Nicolet.
